      <h2 class="heading-secondary">When I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I have been blocked so many times by stupid typo mistakes but I was
        stuck for quite a long time when I was making an unjumble function,
        which is basically just reversing all the words that passed into the
        function and return them. I thought I could just make it quickly by
        using some methods that I had already learned but I kept facing some
        undefined and null messages and I felt frustrated and confused so I
        decided to take some break(watching Friends lol) and sat back at my desk
        again.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I started over from building a logic and I was talking to myself like
        the Rubber ducky method. During this process I could think that there
        might be some other built-in methods that suit more for this function so
        I googled it and found some useful methods(.reverse() method). I learned
        that there are so many useful functions out there so we should always
        check out if there are other functions that we can use for a better code
        result :)
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">When I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I elegantly solved a problem by using console.log() method when I was
        building the JS-Gradebook function through replit. I tried to make sure
        everything is going well step by step from the beginning. For example
        when I made this function below <br />
        addScore(name, score) {<br />
        return gradebook[name]["testScores"].push(score); <br />
        } <br />
        I did console.log(greadebook) first and started chaining till I
        completed the whole return value. I think the huge benefit of this
        approach is you can easily handle the error and I am sure it saves more
        time from coding the whole scope and start fixing from the beginning.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pseudocode / Trying something / Rubber ducky method / Reading error
        messages / Console.logging / Googling / Asking your peers for help /
        Asking coaches for help / Improving your process with reflection
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think I already sort of organized when I need to use what methods
        mentioned above. Reading error messages and Console.logging can be a
        good habit no matter how small your project is but when you build a big
        project then you might want to use Pseudocode not to get lost when
        coding and I recommend the Rubber ducky method when you are stuck and if
        you cannot still figure out then you can search for the solution on
        google. Finally, when you finish coding you can try something new to
        refactor your code or learn something new :)
