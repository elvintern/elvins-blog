        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My ultimate goal is to become a senior front-end developer so that I can
        work remotely while traveling. I assume that along this pathway I might
        find some more interesting part of IT industry then I am willing to give
        it a challenge!
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I consider myself as a realistic and rational person so I know how much
        I should study more to achieve my goal and that makes me never stop
        learning and practicing. I think one of the biggest obstacles is that
        English is my second language. I believe communication skills are very
        important when working in a team so I will keep studying English till I
        have no issue with communication with anyone.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        As I mentioned above, I hope I can improve my English skills and
        communication skills while at Dev Academy. Plus, I want to learn how to
        be more friendly and socialable.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think I am fully ready to focus on this bootcamp because I cut off
        most of my distractions such as playing computer games, drinking, having
        a partner(I broke up early this year) a long time ago. Also, I am good
        at time-management so I am sure I will be able to work productively and
        if things get tough I will never hastitate to ask facilitators for some
        advice.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I would just google to solve the issue first and if I cannot find any
        then I will ask for some facilitators’ help :)
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I hope they can be patient when I am rambling to explain something haha.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I do not have anything planned yet.</p>
