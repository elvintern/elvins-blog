        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My ultimate goal is to become a senior front-end developer so that I can
        work remotely while traveling. I assume that along this pathway I might
        find some more interesting part of IT industry then I am willing to give
        it a challenge!
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I consider myself as a realistic and rational person so I know how much
        I should study more to achieve my goal and that makes me never stop
        learning and practicing. I think one of the biggest obstacles is that
        English is my second language. I believe communication skills are very
        important when working in a team so I will keep studying English till I
        have no issue with communication with anyone.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        As I mentioned above, I hope I can improve my English skills and
        communication skills while at Dev Academy. Plus, I want to learn how to
        be more friendly and socialable.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think I am fully ready to focus on this bootcamp because I cut off
        most of my distractions such as playing computer games, drinking, having
        a partner(I broke up early this year) a long time ago. Also, I am good
        at time-management so I am sure I will be able to work productively and
        if things get tough I will never hastitate to ask facilitators for some
        advice.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I would just google to solve the issue first and if I cannot find any
        then I will ask for some facilitators’ help :)
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I hope they can be patient when I am rambling to explain something haha.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I do not have anything planned yet.</p>

        learning plan (Written on the fifth week of foundation)
      </h1>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My dream goal is to become a senior front-end developer and to achieve
        that I would have to master all the core skills and communication skills
        during the Bootcamp and even after that. I am not saying I already have
        a great tech skills but I pre-studded front-end for the past a year and
        I want to focus more on learning how to be a great team player while at
        the Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I guess my poor English skills would be the limitation during the
        Bootcamp but I have studied front-end for the past a year so I hope I
        will not hold anyone’s back. If anything, I am confident with HTML, CSS,
        SASS and some of JS so I will try to help if any of my team members is
        struggling. Even if I cannot help, I will do my best to figure out the
        solution together and I believe I can improve my English skills and team
        skills along with.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am actually worried about all of the things listed in the question
        hahaha…. I am quite introverted so it would be a challenge for me to
        make friends there not to mention speaking in front of the group… Also,
        I have ADHD so I can easily get distracted… However, I am going to the
        the Bootcamp to overcome all of them and grow better so I will always
        put my 200% effort while at the Bootcamp!!
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I know it sounds greedy but if possible I would love to develop all of
        them!! I am aware that all the skills mentioned above are necessary to
        become senior so I will try to make as much development as I can. I
        cannot wait to see how much I improved those human skills after the
        bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        It would be awesome if I can have somebody to talk to in order to check
        if I am on the right path so I can feel safe and more confident to take
        the next step. Also, if they can correct my English when I make a
        mistake or teach me if there is any other better way to explain the same
        topic since I need to prepare for a job interview as well.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I know that we can find almost all solutions on google but I will try to
        sort it out with my team on our own first and then if we get stuck
        again, we can start looking up on google and try all the methods that we
        find out together. If we cannot still figure out then we will need to
        ask for facilitators’ help to work more productively.
