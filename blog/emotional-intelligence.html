      <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own
        emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. There are
        five key elements to EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation,
        empathy, and social skills. People with high EI can identify how they
        are feeling, what those feelings mean, and how those emotions impact
        their behavior and in turn, other people. It’s a little harder to
        “manage” the emotions of other people - you can’t control how someone
        else feels or behaves. But if you can identify the emotions behind their
        behavior, you’ll have a better understanding of where they are coming
        from and how to best interact with them.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Your IQ is what determines your competencies and individual capacities,
        but your EQ determines how you interact and treat people in your life,
        it shows how you are going to cope with pressures or face the crisis.
        The difference between these two is that no one can alter his/her
        intelligence or reasoning abilities, but anyone can learn to handle
        emotions, to bring success for him.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Why is it important?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows you to empathize
        with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and socially
        aware. How we respond to ourselves and others impacts our home and work
        environments. Living in this world means interacting with many different
        types of people, as well as constant change and surprises. Being
        emotionally intelligent is key to how you respond to what life gives us.
        It’s also a key component of compassion and understanding the deeper
        reasons behind other people's actions. EI is especially important when
        you are dealing with stressful situations like conflict, change, and
        obstacles. During these times, it's critical to remember to practice
        kindness, and being in touch with our emotions can help us do just that.
