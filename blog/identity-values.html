        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think I made an ehtical decision when I broke up with my ex. We both
        knew that we are looking at different goals like she wanted to start a
        family as early as possible and even now I am not ready for that so I
        had to make a decision to break up so I do not waste her time. It was a
        very tough decision to make but I value honesty the most when it comes
        to having a relationship. I do not regret my decision.

        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your

      <p class="paragraph">
        I was raised to be polite and respectful to everyone. I would say it is
        kind of typical Korean culture. However, I think because of that, I
        could start to believe that there is always something that I can learn
        from any person or any experience and it keeps me positive.

        I think consistency and being positive would help me a lot during this
        course because I believe in the theory of 10,000 hours so I will keep
        facing all the challenges and trying to solve them no matter how long it
        takes. I know it would be very difficult and tough mentally and
        physically but I am sure I will become a web developer unless I give up

        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?

        => Sadly, English is my second language and I have been living in NZ for
        almost 5 years only so my English is broken and I guess it is almost
        impossible to be as fluent in English as native speakers so it will make
        me have hard time to read articles and communicate with others.

        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

        When I was doing some team project at Unitec, we had to build a small
        webpage and each of us was in charge of a small part of the whole
        process but it did not go well because we could not go to the next step
        unless the previous step is done. So I suggested we start over all
        together so we can help each other make a decision quicker and review
        the whole process from the beginning to the end. They did not seem happy
        with my suggestion but the quality of our project was standing out
        compared to other groups. Even thought we might have spent more time
        than when we were working individually but I still think it is more
        productive in the long term.
