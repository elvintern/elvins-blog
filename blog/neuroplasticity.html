      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Knowing the concepts of neuroplasticity would benefit people to learn
        how to improve their neuroplasticity by trying one of those concepts.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I will try to enjoy solving problems knowing that my brain would be out
        of my comfort Zone, which means it creates stronger brain cells and
        neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think we can keep our brains active and stimulated by doing some
        activities such as chess, pool, scramble and so on.

      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        It is a mindset that makes you believe that there is no limit to
        yourself. I think it is relevant to Neuroplasticity because they are
        both about growing and training your capacities of your brain without
        any limits.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I got surprised when professor Dweck said she got a letter from a
        13-year-old boy saying he thanks to the professor and he realized that
        he wasted most of his life in the video because I have actually found
        out these concepts and been training myself from the early this year and
        I felt the same way lol.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I will never limit myself and give up on any problems because I know
        they are going to make me stronger and smarter.
