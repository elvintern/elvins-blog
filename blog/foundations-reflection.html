        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I learnt a lot of things during this journey but the three most valuable
        things to me would be how to train “my growth mindset” by some specific
        rules, what type of person I am now because I think I have changed ever
        since I started studying IT and now I can see my strengths and
        weaknesses clearly. The last one would be the belief that I can keep
        overcoming no matter how long it takes or how hard it is.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        We will probably face a lot of obstacles when either learning or
        programming and the things that mentioned above will help us look after
        ourselves better by keeping a check on our emotions. Also, we would be
        empathetic to others around us, which is a key to being a great team
        player.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When I introduced myself to other students on discord and interact with
        them, I felt like I am surely a part of this group!! I have always
        thought my English skills sucks so people will not welcome me or I will
        not feel like I am a member of any group but everytime I chat with some
        co-students or facilitators, it feels so great haha.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think it was the language because writing is probably the worst skills
        out of others… I just hope you could understand what I was trying to say
        and if you do not understand then feel free to DM me…hahaha
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        As you already explained before, we need more core skills than technical
        skills to get hired and become a great developer. I had a doubt at the
        beginning but as time went by I could strongly agree with this and now I
        am trying my best to obtain those skills.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I thought it could be a waste of my time only at the beginning but I
        realized that it is something that I need more than any other skills. I
        hope I can keep learning more of those during the on campus bootcamp
        course as well.
